    CSC 160 Project 2 Notes

    For the data section of the rubric, we think we deserve somewhere between a 30 and a 40. We do have two drill downs, but both show up with only one click. The first click loads up the promise from the "films" page of the API, bringing up the list of the 7 movies and some of their attributes (release date, producer, director, opening crawl, and characters.) The second 'drill-down' is the characters, as in the API this just links to the 'people' section of the API. We had to create another promise for this to be able to load in all of the characters names and access them from a new array. Therefore, each time a different film is accessed from the API, all of the characters are as well. But, we could not get another .onclick to function with an element created from the first one, and it was causing too many issues and breaking other pieces of code so a point came in the project where we had to give it up. So this is two drill-downs and separate pieces of actual data, but they are accessed together.

    For the CSS section of the rubric, we believe that we deserve a 40. Our CSS is completely functional, and is very visually appealing while sticking to the Star Wars theme. It is simplistic, but is very true to the Star Wars universe. The CSS also makes the data more visually appealing and easier to interact with. The 7 films that appear as buttons are all separate list elements within an ordered list that we gave unique IDs and unique background elements too, as well as sizing them to appear as buttons. These are visually appealing as well as interactable and is a good start to the website. After you click on one of these elements, an unordered list is generated for each. As with anything Star Wars, the first thing you see is the opening crawl, giving a quick backstory and basically setting up the story coming into the film. This first list element is given attributes to appear as a standalone element that is right there when you select a film. The rest of the list is a few details about the film, with some lightsaber bullet points just for a small touch, but it isn't overly aggressive. The characters list is simplistic and gives another simple bulleted list at all of the characters in each film. The color of the text is easy on the eyes while thematically fitting with Star Wars, as it is the same color code as all classic Star Wars yellow. We believe our theme is functional, simple, aesthetically pleasing, and fits perfectly with the theme and because of all of this deserving of a 40.

        movie posters labeled for re-use, therefore we have to use the lego ones that were labeled for re-use.
